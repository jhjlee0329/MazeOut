## Project Details

<p>This project is a ReactJS based web-application that visualizes a maze-solving algorithm.</p>
<p>There will be a starting point, end point, and walls of the userâ€™s choice.</p>
<p>Our project will use **recursive backtracking** tosolve the maze from the starting point to the end point while avoiding walls.</p>
<p>We are using ReactJS, a front-end Javascript library to handle the front-end visualization and server-side algorithm calculations</p>

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). See package.json for dependency details.
